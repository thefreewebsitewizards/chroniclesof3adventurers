                            <p class="mb-3">I love this book from Wonderbly, it's a classic story, one of our favourite Christmas tales. The illustrations are beautiful and keep your little one interactive hunting the letters of their name!</p>

                            <p>They usually get a game or large toy to share, this year I've opted for <a href="https://instagram.com/orchardtoys?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" class="text-primary hover:underline">orchardtoys games</a>. We have a few dinosaur games for them to share and a puzzle.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">Titch has a sensory den from <a href="https://instagram.com/earlyyearsresources?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" class="text-primary hover:underline">early years resources</a>. Which is super cool, it's a tuff tray with stand and blackout cover, inside I can add cushions, blankets, lights and other sensory toys for him.</p>
                            <p>Little has a Lego station which I've obtained preloved Lego and cleaned them as well as colour ordered. I've then upcycled the trofast unit from the playroom and added cute labels from <a href="https://instagram.com/this_sonny_day?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" class="text-primary hover:underline">@this_sonny_day</a> (go check her out for all your personalised needs)</p>

                        <p class="mb-3">We also have a stocking each which is usually full of a few fidget type toys or craft supplies. Nothing too expensive.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">The boys have a Christmas Eve box each too which this year they have a book each, jammies, reindeer food, Santa key and food tray, chocolate coins (which I've always been gifted by my mother since I was a little girl) and a few bits that are personalised.</p>
                        <p>As for a gift from the big man, well that's always a small gift, something like a small toy or activity book, it's usually left near the front door or fireplace too with a special sparkly tag (all the tags are reusable and from Emma at @this_sonny_day)</p>
