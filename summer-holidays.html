                    <p class="mb-6">For us this year, we're not even going away for a staycation we're just doing a few days out with the kids. I've planned that two days a week we go for days out, can be paid days out free days out for a picnic at the park. Anything just two days a week. The rest of the week are things like playing at home in the garden or baking and this really helped to take the pressure off having a perfect 24/7 non-stop summer.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3">I believe that children still need a bit of structure and stability to their day to day during summer or half terms with a few nice days out included. As much as you crave to be at home having a relaxing day, children need that too, they need to use their imagination they need to have their creative outlet. They need to chill.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3">This is my reminder to parents to take the pressure off of yourselves during summer, children do not need to be entertained 24 hours a day seven days a week. The most important part is making memories and usually those memories come out of sporadic moments.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">What do you remember from your childhood vacations? I remember baking with my Nanna, picking potatoes with my Grandad and having picnics with my mum. Small little things that will stay with us because it's a time that we have together.</p>
